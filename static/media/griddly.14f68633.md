# Griddly

A large amount of my time in my PhD is spent using grid-world environments and then learning models of then using neural networks.

Grid-world environments are very easy to make with a bit of python code, but they tend to be created for very specific purposes with pre-defined mechanics and levels.

There have been attempts to make the grid-world space more flexible by using procedural content generation, different rendering options and making bespoke scripting languages to allow new games to be defined. Unfortunately all these different features are scattered across many different projects.

Griddly attempts to bring all of these features together in one place.

Griddly has it's own dedicated website with much more information and code examples here:
