# Intro

My name is Chris Bamford AKA "Bam4d".

I've been programming since I was about 11 or 12 years old. 

This blog exists as a way of me communicating my ideas and random thoughts about things I find interesting in the world of technology. I think it should also help me to think though my ideas and experiments better. When you can explain a solution to a wide audience it helps you to understand the underlying problem and validate your solutions.

All my blog posts should have a Disqus comment board at the bottom of the page, so feel free to add comments or questions, and of course point out any mistakes.

## Here's a couple of things I'm interested in
### Machine Learning

I'm a huge fan of the potential of machine learning, especially Deep Learning and Reinforcement learning. The main reason for this blog is so that I can document my experiments and share some of my experiments and achievements.

### Backend

I have experience creating backend server architechture, generally using technologies such as **Java 7/8**, **Spring Boot**, **Eclipse**, **IntelliJ**, **Jetty**, **Gradle**..
I have experience building RESTful APIs in **python**, **C/C++**, **nodeJS** and **lua**

### Frontend

I'm not much of a frontend developer. My design skills are somewhat limited, but I built this blog engine by myself using react and added a couple of tricks and wrappers here and there to get it to do what I want.
I've even written a [blog about how I have created my blog](https://bam4d.github.io/#/post/blogging-using-react-markdown-and-mathjax/1)

### Mathematics

I hold a fair amount of interest in areas of maths such as number theory and how it interconnects with other areas of mathematics. 

I can't honestly say I know a huge amount of number theory, but I'm generally pretty blown away by some of the proofs of strange formulas.

I'm not entirely sure that I will have anything to blog about thats purely mathematical, other than perhaps trying to apply deep learning to some sort of number theory problem that involves something statistical.
